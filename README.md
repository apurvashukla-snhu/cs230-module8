# CS230 Module 8 Journal


    1) Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
    - The client wanted a web app that ran on all operating systems using the web browser. The client was Chada Tech, who wanted to take their mobile game and run it on the browser.
    
    2) What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
    - I believe I followed the client's requirement strictly and provided extensive detail in how they tackle porting the app to a web app.
    
    3) What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
    - The process helps me to streamline my ideas about how to setup a project before work on it is started, and helps to remind what was planned.
    
    4) If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
    - I would probably revise the Domain Model by adding more notes to it.
    5) How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
    - The user's needs are important to consider since that is how they envisioned the app, if the vision is not faulty, then it is better to help proceed with their idea for satisfaction regarding their app. I interepreted the user's needs by taking the time to understand how they intended to setup their new application.
    6) How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
    - I approached the software design by prototyping code and using domain models to help layout the work needed to do. I would use similar strategies to design a similar software application.
